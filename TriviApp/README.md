# TriviApp

A small trivia app. The app asks a series of 13 unchanging questions. The user is able to click a true or a false button. 

When the user clicks a button:
* a toast message will appear indicating whether the question was answered correctly
* the score will increase by 1 if the question was answered correctly
* the progress bar at the bottom will increase as the question number increases
