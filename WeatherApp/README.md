# WeatherApp

This is a fully functional weather app. The app uses https://openweathermap.org/ API to retrieve weather data.
The app default screen requests the user's permission to retrieve the current location and then presents the current weather, the city name, and an icon representing what the weather is like in the current city.

The user can click a button to go to a seperate screen that allows the user to enter in the name of a city. The app will then retrieve the weather for the entered city and display it to the user.
